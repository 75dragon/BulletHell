# BulletHell
My first attempt at a bullet hell game. Scrapped after APCS final came into scope and probably a dead project.  
May be a great starting point for people, everything works and is a decent minimal viable project.  
  
Controls:  
lShift to slow  
z to shoot  
x to charge shot  
arrow keys to move  

Intended for multiplayer but never really pulled though
